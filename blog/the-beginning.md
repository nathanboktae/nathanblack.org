After owning nathanblack.org for several years and doing web development, it's long overdue I have a blog with a few thoughts to share about web development.

This blog is powered by [poet](http://jsantell.github.io/poet/) on top of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [express.js](http://expressjs.com/), with [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) for the CSS preprocessor, but most importantly no jQuery and no bootstrap.

*Update*: See the entry about [the current setup](/post/migration-to-static-site-via-gulp)
