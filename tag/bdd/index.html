In a team that had no tests maintained by developers (<em>shudder</em> how did we develop software this long?) it was a big cultural change led by my great colleages <a href="https://github.com/jonsequitur">Jon Sequiera</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dfrenkel">Dmitry Frenkel</a>, who I am very greatful to have the experience of working with.</p>
<p>At the time we&#39;d write tests for our controllers. We&#39;d mock out all the dependencies it would need in a test and provide them. We were also using the <a href="">repository pattern</a> and testing the controller we&#39;d mock that out. The repository pattern was really needed as we couldn&#39;t actually make a call to the database due to a lot of different reasons that basically stem from a monolithic ball of sphagetti code and abomination that was <a href="http://www.ben-morris.com/entity-framework-anti-patterns-how-not-to-use-an-orm-with-sql-server/">Entity Framework 1.0</a>.</p>
