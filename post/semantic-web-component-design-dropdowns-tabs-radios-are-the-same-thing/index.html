<p>One thing that always drove me nuts about our previous UI was a mismash of different components doing the same thing. We had <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select2">ui-select2</a>, <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-select/">ui-select</a> from the Angular UI team, <a href="https://github.com/isteven/angular-multi-select">angular-multi-select</a> for some multiselect cases, and a custom directive for radio-like toggle boxes.</p>
<p>Each control offered some little feature that another didn&#39;t (except <code>ui-select2</code> which was just in code we didn&#39;t get around to refactoring yet). Why is this? All of them are trying to do the same thing on a higher semantic level: The user needs to pick an one (or more) options from this fixed set of options. How that looks is a styling concern.

<p>Between those design goals and a darth of knockout components, I created <a href="https://github.com/nathanboktae/knockout-choose">knockout-choose</a>. Some goals included:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Modern Web Component design</em> using custom tags so that markup stayed in markup.</li>
<li><em>Semantic markup and API</em> so that any &quot;choose one or more from many&quot; scenario could be addressed.</li>
<li><em>Well tested with hosted CI</em> as how can you ask someone to take a production dependency on your component without them?</li>
</ul>
<p>At the bottom of the <a href="https://nathanboktae.github.io/knockout-choose">knockout-choose demo page</a> is the example of one chooser changing the styling of the other by simply applying a different class. To be even more semantic, you could put these rules in a mixin in your CSS preprocessor. Now if the design changes, your code and tests stay the same! Hooray for separation of concerns!</p>
<p>I hope that others design components along semantic usage so they are easy and flexible to use, regardless of framework, if any. <a href="http://dbushell.github.io/Pikaday/">Pikaday</a> is a great example of this and a great date picker - I highly recommend.</p>
